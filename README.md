The tasks that can be performed by our JARVIS (personal voice assistant) are: 
• We can open YouTube, play and download a song in it. Play songs on other music streaming apps. 
• Can have fun interaction with JARVIS when bored. 
• Can know about current day, date, time, and location. 
• It can open any of your social media accounts or OTT accounts and perform your given task. 
• You can schedule your whole plans or any timetable which will be remembered by JARVIS. 
• It will search anything for you on Wikipedia or any other browser and tell the results. 
• It can read any documents or PDFs. 
• It will tell you latest news. 
• It can send a message on WhatsApp as well as a mail. 

These all tasks are done with help of libraries provided by python.
